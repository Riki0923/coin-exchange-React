# Simple Description

- This coin-exchange project has been built by React, Html, Javascript and CSS.
- Following utilities has been used: Axios, Bootsrap, styled components, fortawesome/fontawesome

## What does it Do?

- It gets the top 10 coins from Coinpaprika, showing its names, tickers and prices
- You are starting with a balance of 10000 dollars, you can add 1200 dollars with the helicopter button each time you click on it
- You can also buy or sell each coins, and it will update your dollar and coin balance as well.

## How to run it?

- I have run this code via npm start (localhost:3000) by React, once you downloaded make sure you download everything from the package.json to be able to see this code working.

## Future Development

- I might upgrade this in the future, it depends on the Programming language I will focus on.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
